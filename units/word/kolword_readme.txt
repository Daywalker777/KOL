This is the KOLword.PAS, containing simple (but power) Word automation object.
To use it, You just should have a list of available properties, methods, objects of the Word application. To get it, use Microsoft Word documentation.

See also demo supplied. Take in attantion, that first of all, a new document should be created. This is done by selecting 'Documents' object as current and invoking its method 'Add'. And read comments in source (or use xHelpGen utility as usual to create html documentation on base of it).
