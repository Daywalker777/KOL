INSTALLATION
Remove previous package.


For Delphi5 required package is attached so just open and Install.

For other:
1. Unpack where You wish preserving relative pathes.
2. Create package (e.g. mckPrint.dpk), add all *.pas files there.
3. Change package options to "Design-time only" and "Rebuild as needed".
4. Save it, compile and install it.
5. Compile projects. Do not forget to check if KOL_MCK conditional is defined in project options.

History :
1.5 26-10-2002
Many minor tweaks.See autogenerated (by xHelpGen) help files for details.
1.4  17-09-2002
[+] Added property Assigned which should always be checked before first access
to TKOLPrinter. If is FALSE then there is no printer in system. (Warning: if You
assign incorrect info to Assign procedure this could lead Your application to
crash rather then return Assigned = FALSE)

[+] Changed Write to WriteLn and improved.Now always print a line of text with
carrage return #10#13 even there is no one at the end of text and should not break
word on bottom-right corner of page

1.3 15-09-2002 
[-]  Fix access violation when there is no printer in system (caused
by DefPrinter function and Assign procedure).

Example:
 with Printer^ do
  begin
        Assign(nil); //default printer (actually not needed as default printer is assigned on start)
        if not Assigned then begin
        MsgBox('There is no default printer in system!',mb_iconexclamation);
        Exit;
        end;
        Title := 'Printing test...';
        Canvas.Font.Assign(Memo1.Font);
        BeginDoc;
         for i:=0 to Memo1.Count-1 do WriteLn(Memo1.Items[i]); //or just WriteLn(Memo1.Text);
        EndDoc;
  end;

One more note:
use psdWarning and pdWarning in PageSetup/Print dialogs to let
user know that there is no printer in system (or no default).
When these options are  not used PrintDialog appear empty but PageSetup dialog never
appears.

Notes:
When output is redirected to a file and You want to know his name , check Output property
but always after sucessful Execute and before EndDoc (becouse EndDoc clears Output property)
Margins are supported but experimental (if You have time and paper please examine
if it working and let me know ;-) - especially if units for margins are properly computed.
Beside let me know what is still missing...

Still missing (I suppose):
- printing text as continuation of current printed line (in the middle of the line)
(this was a nightmare for me , if You know how to do it contact me)
- printing of selected pages only  (must compute pages count)
- collate and printing more than one page when printer do not support multiple pages and collation
(well, should not be very difficult, maybe just check if this is supported and if no just print many times
 the same)
- Printers property (list of printers in system),PrinterIndex and  Fonts property
- print preview
- more tests


1.2 
[+] New procedure RE_Print added to TKOLPrinter which allows printing TKOLRichEdit content 	with all format capabilities (except OleObjects (ex.pictures) becouse are not supported 	by TKOLRichEdit)

[+] AssignMargins procedure in TKOLPrinter allows seleting margins 	in 		TKOLPageSetupDialog and transfer to TKOLPrinter (see Demo)

[-] Fixed bug : Canceling TKOLPageSetupDialog or requesting information (Info function) after 	canceling TKOLPrintDialog selecting throws access violation 	

1.1
[+] TKOLPrinter added.TKOLPageSetupDialog/TKOLPrintDialog support transferring info to TKOLPrinter
(but TKOLPrinter is not required to print on printer DC anyway)
