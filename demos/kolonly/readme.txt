These are several demo projects written for KOL a long time ago. These should work with modern versions of KOL, may be with some small changes in code.

KOL is an abbreviation of Key Objects Library for Delphi which allows creating extremely small executables using Delphi. Delphi versions 2-7 are supported. Mirror Classes Kit extends KOL with a set of mirror classes, which allow to create KOL applications visually.
