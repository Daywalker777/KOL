KOL ASIO SUPPORT
****************

KOL support for the very fast Audio Streaming protocol by
Steinberg Hard und Software Gmbh

Enables you to write audio streaming applications with typically
very low latency if your audiocard comes with ASIO drivers.
(All professional and most modern budget cards do)
Tou need to install openasio.dll (just 50k) with yout application.

A simple example that does no actual streaming is included.
I have succesfully used it in combination with Wave output code, but I can not release that since its from a commercial library.
HINT: Make shure the ASIO buffers match the WaveOut buffers minus
waveOutPrepareHaeders

Released:
July 4, 2003, Thaddy de Koning

IMPORTANT NOTE
**************
Although Steinberg has released the original code to almost any developer that wants it and for free. They reserve certain rights,
amongst which is the signing of a licensing agreement if you use the libraries
or the methods in final products that are released to others.
You are also obliged to use their logo in your about box.
See www.steinberg.com for more information.
THIS code complies in that it is only aimed at developers.
