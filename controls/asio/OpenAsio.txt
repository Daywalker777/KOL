OpenASIO wrapper for ASIO drivers v1.01

(ASIO Technology by Steinberg, http://www.steinberg.net)


Purpose:
- The IASIO COM interface used by ASIO drivers has no explicitly declared calling convention for the 
   functions. This has resulted in the interface being unusable from some compilers (i.e. Delphi).
- OpenAsio provides a simple wrapper dll which exposes an interface where this problem has been corrected.

Wrapper:
- A Visual C++ 6 dll which declares a new COM interface IOpenASIO which matches
   the Steinberg IASIO interface but changes the calling convention to __stdcall.
- Some files from the ASIO SDK will be needed to compile the dll. This is available from
   Steinberg.

Client:
- A Delphi import unit (OpenAsio.pas). This requires (and is included in) the Delphi ASIO SDK
   translation located at http://www.axiworld.be.
- Support for further languages (i.e. non-microsoft C++ compilers) may be added in future.

History:
(v1.01)
- reference counting of the IOpenAsio interface fixed.


OpenAsio is public domain / open source. Please mail comments, etc to:
