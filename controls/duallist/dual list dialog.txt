My first experience with KOL - simple dual list dialog (to visually exchange two list's items).
Idea based on dual list component from RXLibrary.



Usage:
(No MCK mirror as it is not needed.)


procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: PObj);
var
i : Integer;
L1,L2 : PStrList;
begin
L1 := NewStrList;
L2 := NewStrList;
L1.Add('test1a');
L1.Add('test1b');
L2.Add('test2a');
L2.Add('test2b');
if DualListDialog('test1','src','dest',L1,L2) then
for i:=0 to L2.Count -1 do MsgOK(L2.Items[i]);
L1.Free;
L2.Free;
end;

Not a big deal, but useful for example to allow user select people from address list;
Internally KOL form is created with two list box and a couple of buttons to switch items from left to right listbox and back.This form is modal.

Note:
Works ok when uses KOlDual is in implementation section (not interface)
I'm not sure but it can'nt work when Applet is not created.
