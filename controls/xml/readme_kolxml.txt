KOL XML OBJECTS
***************

This archive contains very powerfull yet simple XML objects for use with KOL.

BUT: It is only a subset of the full DOM specification.

I really don't know where the original sources came from, but they were
very well written. I've left all original comments as is.

I rewrote most of it to work with KOL and the results are pretty amazing.
See the enclosed example project.

If anybody knows (must be easily recognisable), where the original code
came from, please let me know so I can give Credit where Credit is due.
There were no copyright claims in the code, so I think it's pretty safe
to assume it's freeware, since it came from my freeware archives and I
am pretty accurate in keeping copyrighted software from other sources.

As usual, all of my code and additions are GPL, LGPL or absolute freeware.
(Pick one that suits you)

Postscript:

The band mentioned in the generated XML document is very good if
you like alternative american (NYC) music styles.
You can download free mp3 examples at their site.
Don't be surprised if this is the next thing after The Strokes!

Highly recommended.
