TdkKolMidi.pas provides a complete midi implementation for KOL.
It is written by Thaddy de Koning based on the work by Robert Rossmair
for the Jedi Code Library.
As such this code is not freeware but subject to the Mozilla Public License agreement.

The object does not need any extra units except for KOL (> 1.44) , ERR and MMSYSTEM

DEMO
****
The demo implements a MIDI keyboard with several features such as
- pitch control
- Modulation
- Octave selection
- Instrument selection
- Note values
- MIDI device selection
- Graphical representation of a MIDI keyboard.

The demo does not use the MCK.

It needs two extra controls from the KOL webside that are not included in this package:
KOLMHUPDOWN and MHTRACKBAR
Please collect these from www.xcl.cjb.net

The code is written very cleanly, not necessarily for size.
Still at under 45 K it's probably one of the smallest keyboards available.
